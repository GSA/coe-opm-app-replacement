## Background

CoE in partnership with OPM, is modernizing the Federal Annuity Claims Expert System (FACES). Retirement Services (RS) is the OPM program division responsible for the administration of retirement benefits. RS staff members depend on FACES to adjudicate about 80,000 federal retirement benefit actions every year. FACES is a reliable and accurate system, but it was built with tools that are no longer supported by the manufacturer, which makes it difficult to update and maintain. FACES wasn’t originally designed as enterprise software and there is limited documentation that describes how FACES works. Also, there is no disaster recovery plan in place in case the application suffers critical failure. Legal Administrative Specialists (LAS) depend on FACES to do their jobs. Their retirement benefits expertise is essential to the adjudication of cases, but making up for the legacy app’s shortcomings forces them to squander time and focus. 

OPM is replacing both the FACES desktop app and the calculator that the app relies on to determine retirement benefits. The app replacement and the calculator replacement are separate projects, but the teams supporting each will communicate regularly. Both projects will begin at roughly the same time, but the Government expects to complete the replacement app well in advance of the replacement calculator. Early in the process, the Contractor responsible for the replacement calculator will supply the app replacement team with application program interface (API) specifications.  

## Purpose

The purpose of the OPM App Replacement contract is to replace the outdated FACES desktop app with a modern web app. The design of the replacement app must help optimize the expertise of the LAS. In the short-term, hand entry of case information will continue to be an aspect of the adjudication experience, but there are opportunities to improve other key interactions between the system and its users. The Government expects the Contractor to deeply research the needs of FACES users to inform the replacement app’s design. After research, the Contractor will continue to work closely with LAS and other users to test and revise designs iteratively in order to deliver a highly effective final product. The Government also expects the Contractor to deliver back-end code that meets the highest standards in app development. The Contractor will create tools and design training that empowers OCIO staff and contractors to maintain the replacement app’s back-end over time. They will also create tools and design training that allows Retirement Services staff to manage many changes to the app’s front-end without requiring OCIO resources.
